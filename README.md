# Handling Missing Values - Machine Learning Exercise

This repository contains my solution for the **Handling Missing Values** exercise from Kaggle.

The objective of this exercise is to understand how to identify, analyze, and handle missing values in a dataset as part of the data preprocessing step in machine learning.

## Exercise Description

In this notebook, I worked on:
- Identifying missing values in the dataset
- Understanding the impact of missing data
- Applying different strategies to handle missing values

All the work is implemented inside the notebook:
**exercise-missing-values.ipynb**

## Topics Covered

The following techniques are used:
- Detecting missing values
- Dropping columns or rows with missing data
- Filling missing values using statistical methods (mean, median, mode)
- Preparing clean data for machine learning models

## Project Structure
